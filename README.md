# ARRuler

The AR Ruler App is an innovative and user-friendly iOS application that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology to measure the distance between two points in 3D space. Built using Swift and ARKit, this app transforms your device into a powerful measuring tool, making it perfect for both personal and professional use.

#Features
Accurate Distance Measurement: Utilize the device’s camera to place virtual markers on real-world objects and measure the distance between them with high precision.
3D Space Tracking: Measure distances in 3D space, providing accurate results regardless of the plane or angle.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and simple interface ensures ease of use for all users, regardless of technical expertise.
Real-Time Visualization: See real-time measurements superimposed on the camera view for immediate feedback and accuracy.
Measurement History: Save and review past measurements for reference and comparison.
Customizable Units: Switch between metric and imperial units based on user preference.
#How It Works
Launch the App: Open the AR Ruler App and grant necessary camera and ARKit permissions.
Calibrate: Calibrate the app by scanning the surrounding environment to identify surfaces and objects.
Place Markers: Tap on the screen to place the first virtual marker at the starting point. Move the device to the endpoint and tap again to place the second marker.
Measure: The app calculates and displays the distance between the two markers in real-time.
Save Measurements: Optionally save the measurement for future reference or share it directly from the app.
#Technologies Used
Swift: The app is developed in Swift, ensuring smooth performance and seamless integration with iOS.
ARKit: Apple’s ARKit framework is utilized to accurately track the device’s position and orientation in 3D space, enabling precise placement of virtual markers.
CoreGraphics: For rendering measurement lines and visual elements.
UIKit: To create a clean and intuitive user interface.
#Use Cases
Home Improvement: Measure spaces for furniture placement, home renovations, and interior design projects.
Education: An educational tool for teaching concepts of geometry, spatial awareness, and AR technology.
Professional Use: Architects, engineers, and contractors can use the app for quick on-site measurements.
Everyday Use: Measure any object or space quickly and accurately without the need for a physical ruler or tape measure.
#Getting Started
To get started with the AR Ruler App, clone the repository and open the project in Xcode. Ensure your device supports ARKit and has the latest iOS version installed. Follow the setup instructions in the README file to build and run the app on your device
